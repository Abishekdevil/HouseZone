IP ADDRESS CONFIGURATION GUIDE
============================

To configure the IP addresses for your application, you need to update the following files:

1. BACKEND SERVER IP ADDRESS
--------------------------
File: src/screens/residential/logic/api.js
Location: Line 2
Current setting: const API_BASE_URL = 'http://10.86.202.103:3000/api';

Change the IP address (10.86.202.103) to your backend server's IP address.
Keep the port (3000) and path (/api) unchanged.

Example for local development:
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/api';

Example for remote server:
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://192.168.1.100:3000/api';

2. DATABASE CONNECTION (if needed)
-------------------------------
File: backend/.env
Location: Line 1
Current setting: DB_HOST=localhost

Change 'localhost' to your MySQL server's IP address if it's hosted remotely.

3. TESTING THE CONNECTION
-----------------------
After making changes:
1. Restart your backend server
2. Restart your frontend application
3. Test by submitting the residential form

The application should now connect to your specified IP addresses.

SEPARATE ROUTES IMPLEMENTED:
--------------------------
- Step 1 data is saved to: /residential/step1
- Step 2 data is saved to: /residential/step2
- Step 3 data is saved to: /residential/step3
- Only one success message is shown: "House details added successfully!"
- Error messages indicate which step failed

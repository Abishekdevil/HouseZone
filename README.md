# HouseZone


**HouseZone** is a simple, user-friendly platform designed to help people Rent, Buy, and Sell houses in one place. The app allows users to create an account, explore available properties, and post their own listings easily.

The platform is built to make real estate transactions simple, transparent, and accessible for everyone. Whether someone wants to rent a home, purchase a property, or sell their house, HomeRental provides a clean and organized experience.
